Package directory modes
=======================
The packages can be built directly from a set of git checkouts (vcs mode),
or from a set of release tarballs (tarball mode).

Vcs mode is useful if you want to work on libreoffice during the development
cycle. You can check out the latest sources and track them while you make
changes.

Tarball mode is used to prepare packages of official libreoffice releases
from the tarballs created by upstream.

Source package creation steps for tarball mode
==============================================
The .orig.tar.gz consists of the (separate) source tarballs available
from The Document Foundation from
http://download.documentfoundation.org/libreoffice/src/<version/

The libreoffice-x.y.z.a.tar.xz is taken verbatim as original tarball:
$ ln -s libreoffice-x.y.z.a.tar.xz libreoffice_x.y.z.orig.tar.xz
$ tar xfvJ libreoffice-x.y.z.a.tar.xz

For a full build you also need helpcontent2 and translations (and the external
modules' tarballs) which normally are git submodules and/or downloaded during
the build.

As dpkg-source expects e.g. helpcontent2 as a subdir we can't directly
symlink (as the tarball contains libreoffice-x.y.z.a/helpcontent2).
We need to create them manually/repack them:

$ tar xfvJ libreoffice-helpcontent2-x.y.z.a.tar.xz
$ tar xfvJ libreoffice-translations-x.y.z.a.tar.xz
$ cd libreoffice-x.y.z.a
$ for i in helpcontent2 translations tarballs; do \
	tar cfvJ ../libreoffice_5.2.1.orig-$i.tar.xz $i; \
  done

The get-orig-source debian/rules target does this with our custom
mk-origtargz script.

Given those files are not in the tarballs above they need to be removed
as otherwise dpkg complains
$ rm ChangeLog-*

We also need the "tarballs".
A standard upstream build downloads it during the build, but we neither can't nor want it here of course. So:

$ rm -rf tarballs
$ mkdir -p tarballs
$ ./autogen.sh $(filter-out --disable-fetch-external,$(CONFIGURE_FLAGS)) --with-all-tarballs
$ make download gb_LO_VER=<version>

or base on an old version and add/remove the files manually and/or symlink
to the old version if this didn't change - see git diff of download.lst. This
is even better given we probably want to add only needed stuff there, and not
all tarballs (most of those we don't use)

See the "Format: 3.0 (quilt)" section dpkg-source(1) for more details.

Package directory layout - vcs mode
===================================

In vcs mode we are working directly from checkouts of the libreoffice sources.

We pull in sources to these places:

 "top" directory - checkout of LO's "core" repo
 debian - git packaging repository from pkg-openoffice project on alioth
 helpcontent2 - checkout of LO's "help" repo (git submodule)
 translations - checkout of LO's "translations" repo (git submodule)
 tarballs - see above in tarball mode

$ git clone git://gerrit.libreoffice.org/core
$ cd core
$ git submodule init

(maybe remove dictionaries again, see .git/config, we don't need it here.)

./g pull -r (git pull -r, but also does the necessary steps for the submodules)

For tarballs/, see above
