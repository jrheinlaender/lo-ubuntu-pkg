Description: "Solver for Nonlinear Programming" extension for LibreOffice
 By default LibreOffice Calc ships with a solver engine for linear
 programming only. This allows the optimization of models to a certain degree.
 However, if the formulas or constraints become more complex,
 nonlinear programming is required. That missing gap is now filled by the
 Solver for Nonlinear Programming extension.
 .
 Currently it incorporates two Evolutionary Algorithms which are able to
 handle floating point and integer variables as well as nonlinear constraints.
