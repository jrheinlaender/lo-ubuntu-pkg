# PLEASE DO NOT MANUALLY EDIT FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY!

The ./debian directory for the libreoffice-l10n package is generated from the
libreoffice package as follows:

 cd libreofffice_* && ./debian/rules update-l10n

This generates an ./debian for the libreoffice-l10n package in
libreoffice_*/debian/debian-l10n directory. Copy that directory over to the
libreoffice-l10n package as ./debian:

 rm -rf libreoffice-l10n_*/debian &&
    cp -a libreoffice_*/debian/debian-l10n libreoffice-l10n_*/debian

The code that generates this is:
- the update-l10n rule in ./debian/rules in the libreoffice package
- using the ./debian/scripts/create-l10n-control script in the libreoffice
  package
- and using the templates in ./debian/debian-l10n (esp. the *.in files)

The split-out of the libreoffice-l10n package is unfortunately needed on Ubuntu
for hardware limitations on the builders. Maintaining the generating code in
another package is unfortunate, but these packages are tightly coupled anyway
and it is the easiest way to continue cooperation with Debian upstream.
