# in the following some tests need RTL and CJK language packs installed to pass.
# he is the example for RTL, zh-tw for CJK (and zh-tw was choosen to also test xx-YY locales)

# Maybe all those tests should be merged into one (especially for the "small" ones like writerperfect or
# "tiny" ones like sfx2,svx,cui.
# But it already takes ~1.5 h (though including copy..) for all them to run on amd64 and the overall autopkgtest
# test timeout is 166 min (a bit over 2.5 hrs.). What are we doing on slow archs?
# And secondly. one might miss breakage if Java or another package is not installed but is
# required because everything needed would be in Depends: then for one test...
# Try to optimize a bit though by not sorting alphabetically but where the  new packages are a superset so
# we can reuse the testbed
